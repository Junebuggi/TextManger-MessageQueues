Goal 1: Create two processes that communicate through message queues. This was done using
    msgget() and having two unique queues. One to pass messages to the Text-Manager (toTextManagerQueue)
    and another to pass messages to the user (toUserQueue).
Goal 2: Create 4 functions to manipulate the text stored in the text manager. This is done
    by using the String.h functions.
Goal 3: Create a data structure to store the text in text-manager. This was accomplished by
    creating a program (singly_linked_list) that has functions to create and manipulate
    linked lists.
Goal 3: Get the average execution time it takes the Text-Manager to execute each command.
    This is done by creating a Average_t struct that has a average variable and a total data
    variable. The time before and after the command is measured to then update the commands
    Average_t pointer variable. Each command's average is printed before the Text-Manager
    process terminates.

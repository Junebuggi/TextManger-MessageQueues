/***** Algorithm for User *****/
Instantiate message queues
Loop while running is 1:
    Get input from user
    send input command to Text-Manager
    if user input is "append":
        Get sentence from user
        Send sentence to Text-Manager
    Else If user input is "delete":
        Get word from user
        Send word to Text-Manager
    Else If user input is "remove":
        Get word from user
        Send word to Text-Manager
    Else If user input is "search":
        Get word from user
        Send word to Text-Manager
        Receive and print sentence from Text-Messager
   Else If user input is "exit":
       running is 0, leave while loop

Exit process

/***** Algorithm for Text-manager *****/
Instantiate message queues
Loop while running is 1:
    Receive command from User (toTextManagerQueue)
    if command is "append":
            Receive sentence from user
            Append sentence to text stored in text-manager
        Else If user input is "delete":
             Receive word from user
             Remove every occurrence of word from text stored in text-manager
        Else If user input is "remove":
            Receive word from user
            Remove first sentence that contains word from text stored in text-manager

            Receive word from user
